Decide whether the user's message is a command to create, modify, or manipulate objects in Reality Flow VR.

If it is a creation-related command (e.g., "spawn a tree", "add a cube", "rotate this"), return "yes".  
If it is unrelated, vague, social, or not clearly executable, return "no".

Respond only in the following JSON format:
{
  "answer": "yes" or "no",
  "reason": "[brief explanation here]"
}

Do not include any additional commentary or thinking outside of this format.
