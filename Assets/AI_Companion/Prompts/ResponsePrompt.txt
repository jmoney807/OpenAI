Decide whether the user's message is a command to create (generate or similar) objects in a VR application.

Respond only in the following JSON format:
{
  "answer": "yes" or "no",
  "reason": "[brief explanation here]"
}

Only respond "yes" if:
- The message is a direct or clearly implied command to take an action in the VR Application.
- The message uses verbs like "create", "make", "generate", "build", "spawn", "place", "add", or similar.
- The message contains common typos or phonetically similar terms (e.g., "psi phi" instead of "sci-fi", "mike" instead of "mic") â€” infer the correct word from context.
- The message includes a noun, even if the request is vague.

Respond "no" if:
- The message is emotional, narrative, social, or a question.
- The message refers to another person (e.g., "he said", "she wants") or appears conversational.
