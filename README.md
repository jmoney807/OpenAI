Reality Flow AI Companion

Sponsor: Dr: Murray

Goal:
	We want our AI Companion in our VR/Unity project to passively listen to the user but only actively generates 3D objects when requested by the user when the context of the user is about creating objects in their project, while also ignoring casual conversations with other users.

Setup: 
  Install both "uvicorn" and "fastapi" in the command line to get started

In your command line, use "uvicorn whisper_api: app --reload" in the directory that you stored it. This will allow local api to call whisper without paying.
